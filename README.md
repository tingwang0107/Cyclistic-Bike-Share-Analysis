# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis
This is a data analyzing case study that is a part of Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone project.  I will be using R coding for this project and also create dashboards via Tableau.

### Introduction
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Cyclistic pricing plans included:

- Casual riders: Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes
- Cyclistic members: Customers who purchase annual memberships

This analysis contains customer's bike-share data for a year (September 2021 - August 2022).This public data for the case study has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

### Scenario
The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the marketing team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,the team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

### Business Task
For Cyclistic executives to approve the recommendations, the project must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.  Director of marketing and my manager in this project, Lily Moreno, has assigned a question to answer:
**How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**
